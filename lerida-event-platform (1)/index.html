      Use the locally-built Tailwind CSS output instead of the CDN.
      Ensure your index.css includes the Tailwind directives:
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
      and that Tailwind is configured in tailwind.config.js.

    <!--
      NOTE:
      - Do NOT use CDN import maps for React/react-dom in a Vite project.
      - Vite will resolve bare imports from node_modules during dev and build.
      - If you serve the app under a subpath, set VITE_BASE_PATH (or the `base`
        option in vite.config.ts) and ensure paths to assets are correct.

      Use a single module entry; point to your app's client entry file.
      Common pattern: /src/main.tsx (adjust if your entry file is named differently).
      Vite will resolve imports like `import React from 'react'` from node_modules.
